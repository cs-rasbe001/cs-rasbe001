## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am Ryan, currently working on my CS degree at ODU. I am a Boy Scout and currently an IT professional who is certified in Security+ and IT Fundamentals+!
This is a personal repository for my classwork that is steadily growing with each assignment, and alongside my skills! I only hope I can get better.
